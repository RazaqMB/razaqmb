            <p><strong>Name:</strong></p> Musa-Bello Razaq Omotesho
            <p><strong>AltSchool ID:</strong></p> ALT/SOE/024/1535
            <p><strong>Biography:</strong></p> I am a deep-thinking and introspective individual who finds joy in the quiet corners of life. Preferring the comfort of home over the bustle of the outside world, I like to watch movies, sometimes read books, and play some adventurous video games at my leisure time. With a curious mind and a love for immersive experiences, I continue to explore new perspectives while staying true to my introverted nature.
